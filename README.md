## Creating a simple machine learning model
The model was created to predict the classification of flower using information like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width. <br>
Confusion matrix was used to evaluate the model. <br>
Six different algorithms were used to train the model. <br>
Box plots were created to visualise which algorithm performed the best. <br>
Skills required: Python, Machine Learning, understanding of algorithms and basic understanding of statistics. <br>

## Threat Hunting with AWS Honeypot Data
Download the Marx-geo dataset from the following link: <br>
Threat Hunting is a proactive and iterative way of finding threats in a dataset or across the network. <br> 
The purpose of threat hunting is to find threats quicker and improve the organisations security system. <br>
R and python were used to create visuals to find outliers in the dataset. <br>
Malicious activities were investigated using tools like IBM X-Force Exchange. <br>
Skills required: Security Intelligence, statistical analysis, visualisation, Python and R studio. <br>

## Using classification algorithm to analyse student performance data

The algorithm, K nearest neighbour has been used to create a model for predicting if a student will fail on an exam. <br>
Preprocessing was completed to explore the data. <br>
KNeighborsClassifier was used to train the model. <br> 
Four and six features were used to model. <br>
GridSearchCV was used to configure optimal parameters for the model. <br>
Confusion Matrix was used to evaluate the model. <br>
Box Plot was created to visualise how the model performed. <br>
Skills required: Python, Machine Learning, understanding of algorithms and basic understanding of statistics.
