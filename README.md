## Creating a simple machine learning model
The model was created to predict the classification of flower using information like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width. <br>
Confusion matrix was used to evaluate the model. <br>
Six different algorithms were used to train the model. <br>
Box plot was created to visualise which algorithm performed the best. <br>
Skills required: Python, Machine Learning, understanding of algorithms and basic understanding of statistics. <br>

## Using classification algorithm to analyse student performance data

Download the Student Performance dataset from the following link: <br>

Dataset = https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance <br>
The algorithm, K nearest neighbour has been used to create a model for predicting if a student will fail on an exam. <br>
